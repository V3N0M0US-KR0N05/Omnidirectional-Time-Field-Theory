The perception of time.
Time as we know is a motion flowing from the past to the present, constructed by the laws we know bounded by earth, we shackled time unknowing its potential.
If time is a motion that can move from the past to the present, it should also be able to move from left to right, from up to down, on all axis. Bold of us to assume time flows in one direction when it flows in omni directions. There is no up or down, no left or right in the vastness of the ever expanding and limitless we know nothing about. Time is not woven by space but gravity.
